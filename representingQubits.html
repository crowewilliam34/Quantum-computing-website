            <p id="Representation_Paragraph">Qubits are often represented using vectors in a 
                two-dimensional complex vector space. The basis states of a qubit are typically 
                denoted as |0⟩ and |1⟩, which correspond to the classical bit values 0 and 1, respectively.
                <br><br>
                A general state of a qubit can be expressed as a linear combination of these basis states:
                |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, where α and β are complex numbers known as probability amplitudes. 
                The probabilities of measuring the qubit in the |0⟩ or |1⟩ state are given by the squares 
                of the magnitudes of these amplitudes: P(0) = |α|^2 and P(1) = |β|^2, with the constraint 
                that |α|^2 + |β|^2 = 1. 
                <br><br>
                This representation allows for the description of superposition and entanglement, which are 
                fundamental concepts in quantum computing. Here are some important qubit states.
