        <p id="Introduction_Paragraph">Quantum computer science does not use classical bits for computation, instead
            it uses quantum bits, or qubits. Qubits can exist in a superposition of states, meaning they can be partly in
            the 1 state and partly in the 0 state at the same time, essentially existing as a waveform which collapses when 
            a measuremnt is taken. The chance of measuring a one or a zero is dependent on the current state of the qubit.
            This property allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.
            Quantum computer science explores the principles and applications of quantum computing, including quantum algorithms,
            quantum error correction, and quantum cryptography.
